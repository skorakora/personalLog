    -Day summary
        -Audio summary with my work and black bacground with day stats:
            -Efficency automatically calculated 15 bloks done means 100% efficenc (15/15)
            -Tasks done, during every blok I can log task that has been done.
            -Maybe day goal met yes/no


Everything should be asseambled automatically. My only interaction is to pres alt+a to start recording alt+s to finish recording alt+d to use commands


Typical generated video title should follow pattern:

Example title:
-Video Log 24SEP2023

Pattern:
-Video Log Day|Month|Year


Later use of those video logs might be used for AGI to learn about me, and to help me with tasks later based on my knowledge
